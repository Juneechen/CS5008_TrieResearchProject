## Introduction
This report looks at the fundamental concepts of the Trie data structure and its application. [Trie], also known as prefix tree or digital tree, is a data structure used for storing and retrieving sequence of symbols from within a set. The sequence of symbols could be binary bits or ASCII characters. The idea of a trie was first abstractly described by Axel Thue in 1912, and later independently described by Edward Fredkin in 1960. Its name came from the word 'Retrieval' but it is now most often pronounced as /ˈtraɪ/. Tries are commonly used to solve problems involve searching, spell checking, autocompletion, and other text processing operation. The rest of this report on Trie will discuss its implementation details, time and space complexity, and some use cases. Additionaly, the advantages and limitations of Trie will be discussed in comparison with other data structures.

## Analysis of Algorithm/Datastructure
Make sure to include the following:
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- General analysis of the algorithm/datastructure

## Empirical Analysis
- What is the empirical analysis?
- Provide specific examples / data.


## Application
- What is the algorithm/datastructure used for?
- Provide specific examples
- Why is it useful / used in that field area?
- Make sure to provide sources for your information.


## Implementation
- What language did you use?
- What libraries did you use?
- What were the challenges you faced?
- Provide key points of the algorithm/datastructure implementation, discuss the code.
- If you found code in another language, and then implemented in your own language that is fine - but make sure to document that.


## Summary
- Provide a summary of your findings
- What did you learn?
